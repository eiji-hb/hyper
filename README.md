# Tableau Hyper API

[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

The Hyper API contains a set of functions you can use to automate your interactions with Tableau `.hyper` files.
You can use the API to create new Hyper files, to open existing files, as well as to insert, delete, update, and read data from those files.
Using the Hyper API developers and administrators can:

- Create Hyper files for data sources not currently supported by Tableau.
- Automate custom extract-transform-load (ETL) processes (for example, implement rolling window updates or custom incremental updates).
- Retrieve data from a Hyper file.
